# YT Shorts Remover

Link for the extension: **needs to be added**

# How does this extension work?

This extension removes anything Shorts-related on YouTube by removing the elements from the DOM whether it is on the homepage, the sidebar or in search results.

So far, this extension has been tested on **Google Chrome** and **Brave**.

**Please note that you can bypass this extension using the URL directly, e.g. https://www.youtube.com/shorts/ - this extension just hides the shorts from the page itself!**

# Setup
Setting up the extension without installing it from the Chrome Web Store is explained in the following:

1. Install the repository and unzip it
2. Go to your browser and type in
``
*your_browser*://extensions/
``
for example: 
``
brave://extensions/
``
3. Enable **Developer Mode**
4. Click on **Load Unpacked** and choose the YT Shorts Remover folder
5. Done - go visit **https://www.youtube.com/** to see if the extension works!

**Please note that you will not get any updates if you use the extension in that way!**
